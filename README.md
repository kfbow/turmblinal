Tumblr client for the terminal
## About
An idea @grahamvo and I joked about and decided to throw together. This is a simple prject that will allow you to view your tumblr dashboard in the terminal. The images are converted into ASCII and given color. Uses node.js to display the dashboard.

First the user who posted the images name will be displayed followed by the amount of notes on the picture. The image will be displayed below the test (example below).
